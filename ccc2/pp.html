<p><strong>2014 Summer Learn to Paddle Program</strong></p>

<p>Our Youth Learn to Paddle Program offers an all around paddling experience. The program is geared to a two-week session. We feel that participants have the opportunity to experience all facets of paddling and become comfortable in the racing boats over this period of time. On water activities include paddling in recreation canoes, whitewater kayaks, sprint racing canoes and kayaks, the 14 person sprint war canoe, and 20 person dragon boat.<br>
<br>
Basic water safety is covered along with all the basics of the equipment and strokes and skills for the various boats.<br>
<br>
Dry land activities will make up the remainder of the day. The emphasis is on active games and events in and around the Clubhouse (soccer, capture the flag, the CCC amazing race, etc).<br>
<br>
We realize a one week program may be more suitable for some looking for a brief introduction to paddling. Therefore, participants may sign up for a one week session. We will offer limited spaces for one week camps. One week sessions are only available for the first week of all two week sessions.<br>
<br>
To register, choose which session you would like to start and for how many consecutive sessions you would like to participate in.<br>
<br>
All programs take place at the Calgary Canoe Club site. The Clubhouse offers an indoor paddling tank, hall area, and sprint bay specifically for camp participants. In poor weather situations we may move activities indoors.<br>
<br>
Pre and post care available from 8:30am - 5:30pm under the supervision of our boat bay staff, must note on your registration form.<br>
