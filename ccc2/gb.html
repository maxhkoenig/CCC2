<h2>Hall Rental Information</h2>

<p>The Glenmore Canoe and Rowing Clubhouse is a non-smoking facility located in North Glenmore Park at the South end of Crowchild Trail. The upper hall offers a beautiful view of the lake with an outside upper deck. The banquet room can seat 100 people but is licensed for 120. There is also an outdoor deck that can be used during the summer months. The room has a small kitchen with an oven, small microwave and fridge. During the warmer months of the year (May-October) the main parking lot gets congested, there is extra parking further away in the park. There are also a few days in the summer when special events happen in the park that close the parking lot.</p>

<p>This location is open for bookings for weddings, parties, lunches, business meetings, and seminar and sporting groups until further notice.</p>
