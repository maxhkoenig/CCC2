<p>If you are a non-member, you have the option to rent a canoe for:<br>
<strong>$35 for the day<br>
$25 for a half day (after 3 p.m. or under 3 hours)<br>
$15.00 for one hour<br></strong></p>

<p><i>This price includes a tin canoe, paddles and lifejackets</i></p>

<p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Our canoes are aluminum with 2 seats. You may take a 3rd person sitting in the middle-bottom of the canoe.<br>
To prevent capsizing, ensure proper balance in the boat by distributing weight evenly.<br>
<br>
<strong>Safety Notes:</strong> Yes - Canoes do tip over. If you are not prepared for this to happen you should not go out. Windy conditions are also a factor, making it easier to tip.<br>
<br>
All paddlers must be confident they can swim if the canoe does tip over.<br></strong></p>

<ul>
 <li>Stay close to shore</li>

 <li>Stay close to the Clubhouse in poor weather conditions</li>

 <li>Please stay off the race course</li>

 <li>Give right of way to all other vessels on the reservoir (SS Moyie paddleboat, Rowers, Dragon Boats and competitive canoes and kayaks)</li>

 <li>Clothing suggestions: We suggest you wear clothing that is not restrictive in case you do get wet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Rentals are first come first serve and no reservations are taken. With over 25 canoes we typically have plenty of boats. You can call ahead for those very warm, sunny weekend afternoons to check on availability if wanted. Reservoir bylaw also requires lifejackets to be worn at all times while on the Glenmore reservoir. An exception to the lifejacket bylaw includes paddling competitions amongst seasoned athletes.</p><br>
